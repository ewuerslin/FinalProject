    <h3>Lighting</h3>
    <p>Different types of plants prefer different levels of light. Almost all plants like bright indirect light. There are some types of plants that will tolerate low lighting conditions
    although, they will not grow new leaves. These plants include snake plants, zz plants, philodendrens, and pothos. If you find that a plant does not seem to be thriving,
    take note of how much light they receive in a day and adjust accordingly. <br><br>Just as plants can get not enough light, they can also have too much. If in direct sun the leaves
    can become scorched and brown. </p>

    <h3>Soil</h3>
    <p>While most plants will do ok with a basic potting soil mix there are always ways to optimize. Certain plants like succulents like very chunky soil that allow water to drain
    easily so as not to overwhelm the roots with water. This can be achieved by using an orchid mix from the store.
        Additional perlite can be used to help create a less dense soil for standard plants that don't need specialized soil.</p>

    <h3>Watering</h3>
    <p>Overwatering is possibly the biggest plant killer. Many people like to stick to a schedule when watering their plants, say once a week, without checking to see if the plant
    does indeed need water. While a moisture meter can be used to give an ok reading on the moisture level in the soil, I believe a better way is to use your finger. Simply
    stick your finger into the soil up to the second knuckle. If the soil is dry, proceed to water. If wet, don't water and try again in a couple of days depending on the heat levels
    where the plants are. Houseplants will need significantly less water in the winter than in the summer. </p>
